# common-blocks

This repo contains a number of blocks of code which can be easily pulled in from
CNDI Templates. By hosting these files remotely we are able to keep the
templates small and focused on the task at hand.

If you are interested in contributing or requesting new blocks, please begin by
creating an issue.
